# DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_IdRead Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-B826AB75-F4E4-4A5B-8189-23C99CCF9936.md)

## C

```c
bool DRV_NAND_FLASH_IdRead(const DRV_HANDLE handle, uint32_t *readId, uint8_t address)
```

## Summary

Gets identifier codes from NAND Flash.

## Description

This routine read identifier codes from NAND Flash.

## Preconditions

The DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_Open\(\) routine must have been called for the specified NAND FLASH driver instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|
|readId|Pointer to 32-bit unsigned int into which ID will be stored|
|address|Address to be send after command cycle. Address 0x20 is used for ONFI compliant Flash.|

## Returns

*true* - If ID read successfully from the flash

*false* - If invalid handle

## Example

```c
#define NAND_FLASH_ADDR_ONFI_SIGNATURE 0x20
uint32_t readId = 0;
DRV_HANDLE handle; // Returned from DRV_NAND_FLASH_Open

if (DRV_NAND_FLASH_IdRead(handle, &readId, NAND_FLASH_ADDR_ONFI_SIGNATURE))
{
    // ID read successfully
}
```

## Remarks

This routine will block for hardware access.
