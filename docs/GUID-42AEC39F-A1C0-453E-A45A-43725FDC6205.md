# I2C\_BB\_CallbackRegister Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-6CBA8AA0-7EF7-44B1-8D12-CD6A3067E53A.md)

## C

```c
void I2C_BB_CallbackRegister(I2CBB_CALLBACK callback, uintptr_t contextHandle)
```

## Summary

Sets the pointer to the function \(and it's context\) to be called when the given I2C's transfer events occur.

## Description

This function sets the pointer to a client function to be called "back" when<br />the given I2C transfer events occur. It also passes a context value<br />\(usually a pointer to a context structure\) that is passed into the function<br />when it is called. The specified callback function will be called from the<br />timer peripheral interrupt context.

## Precondition

I2C\_BB\_Initialize must have been called for the associated I2C instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|callback|A pointer to a function with a calling signature defined by the I2CBB\_CALLBACK data type. Setting this to NULL disables the callback feature.|
|contextHandle|A value \(usually a pointer\) passed \(unused\) into the function identified by the callback parameter.|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
void MyI2CCallback(uintptr_t context)
{
    // This function will be called when the transfer completes. Note
    // that this function executes in the context of the I2C interrupt.
}

I2C_BB_Initialize();

I2C_BB_CallbackRegister(MyI2CCallback, NULL);
```

## Remarks

None.
