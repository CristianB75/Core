# SYS\_TIME\_CountToUS Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-3D84F884-122D-4A4A-95DA-DFD8C2E84650.md)

## C

```c
uint32_t SYS_TIME_CountToUS ( uint32_t count )
```

## Summary

Converts a counter value to time interval in microseconds.

## Description

This function converts a counter value to time interval in<br />microseconds, based on the hardware timer frequency as configured<br />and as reported by SYS\_TIME\_FrequencyGet.

## Precondition

The SYS\_TIME\_Initialize function should have been called before calling this function.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|count|Counter value to be converted to an equivalent value in microseconds.|

## Returns

Number of microseconds represented by the given counter value. \|

## Example

Given a previously captured 32-bit counter value called "timestamp"<br />captured using the SYS\_TIME\_CounterGet function, the following example<br />will calculate the number of microseconds elapsed since timestamp was<br />captured.

```c
uint32_t count = SYS_TIME_CounterGet() - timestamp;
uint32_t us = SYS_TIME_CountToUS(count);
```

## Remarks

None.
