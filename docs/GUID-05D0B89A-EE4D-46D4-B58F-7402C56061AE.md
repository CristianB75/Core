# Time System Service

The Timer System Service Library is capable of providing periodic or one-shot alarm and delays to the user. It uses a hardware timer peripheral library for providing it's timing services.

**Key Features:**

-   Periodic notifications

-   One-shot/single notification

-   Delays

-   Support for both tick-based and tickless modes

    -   Tick-less mode: Instead of getting interrupted from the hardware timer periodically, the Time System Service manages the hardware timer so as to generate an interrupt only when required and at appropriate times.

    -   Tick-based mode: A periodic interrupt is generated by the hardware timer. The tick-rate is configurable by the user and defines the resolution for all the timers.
