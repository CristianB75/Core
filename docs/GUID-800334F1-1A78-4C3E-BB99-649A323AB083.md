# DRV\_AT25DF\_Open Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-6D9FA3F1-00EF-4C4D-AC06-CF95F5137ACB.md)

## C

```c
DRV_HANDLE DRV_AT25DF_Open
(
    const SYS_MODULE_INDEX drvIndex,
    const DRV_IO_INTENT ioIntent
)
```

## Summary

Opens the specified AT25DF driver instance and returns a handle to it.

## Description

This routine opens the specified AT25DF driver instance and provides a<br />handle that must be provided to all other client-level operations to<br />identify the caller and the instance of the driver. The ioIntent<br />parameter defines how the client interacts with this driver instance.

This driver is a single client driver, so DRV\_AT25DF\_Open API should be<br />called only once until driver is closed.

## Precondition

Function DRV\_AT25DF\_Initialize must have been called before calling this function.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|drvIndex|Identifier for the object instance to be opened|
|ioIntent|Zero or more of the values from the enumeration DRV\_IO\_INTENT "ORed" together to indicate the intended use of the driver. Note: This driver ignores the ioIntent argument.|

## Returns

If successful, the routine returns a valid open-instance handle \(a number identifying both the caller and the module instance\).

If an error occurs, the return value is DRV\_HANDLE\_INVALID. Error can occur

-   if the driver has been already opened once and in use.

-   if the driver instance being opened is not initialized or is invalid.


## Example

```c
DRV_HANDLE handle;

handle = DRV_AT25DF_Open(DRV_AT25DF_INDEX, DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE);
if (handle == DRV_HANDLE_INVALID)
{
    // Unable to open the driver
    // May be the driver is not initialized
}
```

## Remarks

The handle returned is valid until the DRV\_AT25DF\_Close routine is called.
