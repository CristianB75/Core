## Summary

Handle identifying the transfer request queued.

## Description

A transfer handle value is returned by a call to the DRV\_SPI\_ReadTransferAdd<br />or DRV\_SPI\_WriteTransferAdd or DRV\_SPI\_WriteReadTransferAdd functions. This<br />handle is associated with the transfer request passed into the function and it<br />allows the application to track the completion of the transfer request.<br />The transfer handle value returned from the "transfer add"<br />function is returned back to the client by the "event handler callback"<br />function registered with the driver.

This handle can also be used to poll the transfer completion status using<br />DRV\_SPI\_TransferStatusGet API.

The transfer handle assigned to a client request expires when a new transfer<br />request is made after the completion of the current request.
