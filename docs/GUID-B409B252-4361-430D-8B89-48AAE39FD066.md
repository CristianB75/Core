**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-E18B0923-4286-4E08-A2EB-9A482E0063AE.md)

## C

```c
MEMORY_DEVICE_TRANSFER_STATUS DRV_MEMORY_TransferStatusGet
(
    const DRV_HANDLE handle
);
```

## Summary

Gets the current status of the transfer request on attached device.

## Description

This routine gets the current status of the transfer request. The application<br />must use this routine where the status of a scheduled request needs to be<br />polled on.

The application can alternatively register a transfer handler to receive the<br />transfer completion events.

## Preconditions

DRV\_MEMORY\_Open\(\) must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open function|

## Returns

-   MEMORY\_DEVICE\_TRANSFER\_ERROR\_UNKNOWN

    -   If the handle is invalid

    -   If the status read request fails

-   MEMORY\_DEVICE\_TRANSFER\_BUSY

    -   If the current transfer request is still being processed

-   MEMORY\_DEVICE\_TRANSFER\_COMPLETED

    -   If the transfer request is completed


## Example

```c
// memoryHandle is the handle returned by the DRV_MEMORY_Open function.

if (MEMORY_DEVICE_TRANSFER_COMPLETED == DRV_MEMORY_TransferStatusGet(memoryHandle))
{
    // Operation Done
}
```

## Remarks

This routine will block for hardware access. Used in Async mode of operation.
