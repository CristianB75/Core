# DRV\_SDSPI\_Close Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-7A1B4F41-7CC6-49CF-941E-25265059D247.md)

## C

```c
void DRV_SDSPI_Close
(
    const DRV_HANDLE handle
)
```

## Summary

Closes an opened-instance of the SD Card driver.

## Description

This routine closes an opened-instance of the SD Card driver, invalidating<br />the handle.

## Precondition

The DRV\_SDSPI\_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified SD Card driver instance.

DRV\_SDSPI\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|

## Returns

None

## Example

```c
DRV_HANDLE handle; // Returned from DRV_SDSPI_Open

DRV_SDSPI_Close (handle);
```

## Remarks

After calling this routine, the handle passed in "handle" must not be used with any of the remaining driver routines. A new handle must be obtained by calling DRV\_SDSPI\_Open before the caller may use the driver again. This routine may block for other client-level operations to complete.

Note: Usually there is no need for the driver client to verify that the Close operation has completed.
