# AT24 Driver

This driver provides a non-blocking interface to read and write to external AT24 EEPROM. The library uses the I2C peripheral library \(PLIB\) to interface with the AT24

**Key Features:**

-   Supports a single instance of the AT24 EEPROM and a single client to the driver

-   Supports page writes

-   Supports writes to random memory address within page boundaries

-   The library interface is compliant to the block media interface expected by the **Memory Driver**. This allows running a file system on the AT24 EEPROM using the Memory Driver and the File System Service

-   The library can be used in both Bare-Metal and RTOS environments
