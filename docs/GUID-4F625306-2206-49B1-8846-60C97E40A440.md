# Debug System Service

The Debug System Service provides a set of functions that allow the developer to output debug and/or error messages based on a global error level. The messages are sent to the System Console Service, where they are routed to a console device.

The Debug System Service maintains a global error level, which may be set during initialization and changed dynamically at run-time. Both formatted and unformatted messages can be output or not, depending on the current global error level.
