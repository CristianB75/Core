# Console System Service

The Console System Service is a middleware library that is part of a layered software architecture. The purpose of this software layering is to allow each module to provide a consistent interface to its client, thus making it easy for the developer to add and remove modules as needed.

The console core layer\_provides a POSIX-like read/write API to applications and middleware libraries to send and receive data to and from the console device. Data and message buffering, along with the details of the data transfer are contained within the console device and peripheral library \(PLIB\) layers.
