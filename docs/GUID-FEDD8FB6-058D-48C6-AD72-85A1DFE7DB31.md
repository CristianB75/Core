    -   When Selected littleFS File system will be used

    -   **Make LittleFS File System Read-Only:**

        -   When selected littleFS code is compiled with Read only option enabled.

    -   **Size Of LFS image \(in KB\):**

        -   Specifies the size of the LFS image to be used

-   **Enable Long File Name Support:**

    -   When selected Long file name support is enabled. This option is selected by default

    -   If disabled, the file name length should follow the 8.3 format \(Short file name\)

-   **File Name Length:**

    -   Max file name length to be supported

-   **Current Working Directory Scratch buffer length in Bytes:**

    -   Buffer size to store the current directory path

-   **Enable Cache Line Aligned Buffer for Cache Management**

    -   when enabled file system will use this aligned buffer to submit the request to Media if the input buffer for the read/Write operations is not aligned to Cache Line Size

    -   **Aligned Buffer Length in Multiple of 512 Bytes:**

        -   Specifies the length of the internal file system aligned buffer. Increasing the length of the buffer will increase the **write throughput** but consume more RAM memory

-   **RTOS Settings:**

    -   These options will be enabled when any of the RTOS is added in MHC

    -   **Stack Size \(in Bytes\):**

        -   Specifies the stack size for the File system task/thread

        -   The size can vary based on RTOS and should be configured based on application requirement

    -   **Task Priority:**

        -   Specifies the priority for the File system task/thread. The value can vary based on RTOS used

    -   **Use Task Delay?**

        -   When enabled the File system task will be scheduled out voluntarily after every run based on the delay configured.

        -   **Task Delay:**

            -   Specifies the duration the task has to go to sleep after every run.

            -   Should be configured carefully based on the application need and number of task running along in the system


**RTOS Settings For MicriumOS-III RTOS**

Below additional options are visible in **File Systems RTOS settings** when the MicriumOS-III is added into project graph

![rtos_settings_micrium_os_iii](GUID-B3EFA16B-3DAF-49D1-9E11-DBA535F90156-low.png)

-   **Maximum Message Queue Size:**

    -   This argument specifies the maximum number of messages that the task can receive through internal message queue.

        -   A MicriumOS-III task contains an optional internal message queue \(if OS\_CFG\_TASK\_Q\_EN is set to DEF\_ENABLED in os\_cfg.h\).

    -   The user may specify that the task is unable to receive messages by setting this argument to 0

-   **Task Time Quanta:**

    -   The amount of time \(in clock ticks\) for the time quanta when Round Robin is enabled.

    -   If you specify 0, then the default time quanta will be used which is the tick rate divided by 10.

-   **Task Specific Options:**

    -   Contains task-specific options. Each option consists of one bit. The option is selected when the bit is set.

    -   The current version of MicriumOS-III supports the following options:

        -   **Stack checking is allowed for the task:**

            -   Specifies whether stack checking is allowed for the task

        -   **Stack needs to be cleared:**

            -   Specifies whether the stack needs to be cleared

        -   **Floating-point registers needs to be saved:**

            -   Specifies whether floating-point registers are saved.

            -   This option is only valid if the processor has floating-point hardware and the processor-specific code saves the floating-point registers

        -   **TLS \(Thread Local Storage\) support needed for the task:**

            -   If the caller doesnï¿½t want or need TLS \(Thread Local Storage\) support for the task being created.

            -   If you do not include this option, TLS will be supported by default. TLS support was added in V3.03.00
