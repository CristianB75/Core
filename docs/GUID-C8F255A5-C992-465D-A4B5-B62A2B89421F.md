# DRV\_MEMORY\_SyncWrite Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-E18B0923-4286-4E08-A2EB-9A482E0063AE.md)

## C

```c
bool DRV_MEMORY_SyncWrite
(
    const DRV_HANDLE handle,
    void *sourceBuffer,
    uint32_t blockStart,
    uint32_t nBlock
);
```

## Summary

Writes data for the specified number of memory blocks in Synchronous mode.

## Description

This function schedules a blocking write operation for writing blocks<br />of data into attached devices memory.

## Preconditions

DRV\_MEMORY\_Open\(\) routine must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle. The memory block which has to be written, must have been erased before using the DRV\_MEMORY\_xxxErase\(\) routine.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open function|
|sourceBuffer|The source buffer containing data to be programmed into media device memory|
|blockStart|Block start from where the data should be written to.|
|nBlock|Total number of blocks to be written.|

## Returns

-   true

    -   If the transfer request is successfully completed.

-   false

    -   If the source buffer pointer is NULL

    -   If the client opened the driver for read only

    -   If the number of blocks to be written is either zero or more than the number of blocks actually available

    -   If the driver handle is invalid


## Example

```c
#define BUFFER_SIZE 4096
uint8_t writeBuffer[BUFFER_SIZE];

// Use DRV_MEMORY_GeometryGet () to find the write region geometry.
uint32_t blockStart = 0x0;
uint32_t nBlock = BUFFER_SIZE / block_size; // block_size for write geometry

// memoryHandle is the handle returned by the DRV_MEMORY_Open function.

if(DRV_MEMORY_SyncErase(memoryHandle, blockStart, nBlock) == false)
{
    // Error handling here
}

if(DRV_MEMORY_SyncWrite(memoryHandle, &writeBuffer, blockStart, nBlock) == false)
{
    // Error handling here
}

```

This API is supported only in RTOS environment.
