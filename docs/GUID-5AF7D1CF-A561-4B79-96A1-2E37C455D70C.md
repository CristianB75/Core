# DRV\_SDSPI\_EVENT\_HANDLER Typedef

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-7A1B4F41-7CC6-49CF-941E-25265059D247.md)

## C

```c
typedef SYS_MEDIA_EVENT_HANDLER DRV_SDSPI_EVENT_HANDLER;

```

## Summary

Pointer to a SDSPI Driver Event handler function

## Description

This data type defines the required function signature for the SDSPI event<br />handling callback function. A client must register a pointer to an event<br />handling function whose function signature \(parameter and return value<br />types\) match the types specified by this function pointer in order to<br />receive event calls back from the driver.

If the event is DRV\_SDSPI\_EVENT\_COMMAND\_COMPLETE, it means that the<br />write or a erase operation was completed successfully.

If the event is DRV\_SDSPI\_EVENT\_COMMAND\_ERROR, it means that the scheduled<br />operation was not completed successfully.

The context parameter contains the handle to the client context, provided<br />at the time the event handling function was registered using the<br />DRV\_SDSPI\_EventHandlerSet function. This context handle value is<br />passed back to the client as the "context" parameter. It can be any value<br />necessary to identify the client context or instance \(such as a pointer to<br />the client's data\) instance of the client that made the read/write/erase<br />request.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|event|Identifies the type of event|
|commandHandle|Handle returned from the Read/Write requests|
|context|Value identifying the context of the application that registered the event handling function|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
void APP_SDSPIEventHandler(
    DRV_SDSPI_EVENT event,
    DRV_SDSPI_COMMAND_HANDLE commandHandle,
    uintptr_t contextHandle
)
{
    // contextHandle points to myAppObj.
    
    switch(event)
    {
        case DRV_SDSPI_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE:
        {
            // This means the data was transferred successfully
            break;
        }
        
        case DRV_SDSPI_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR:
        {
            // Error handling here
            break;
        }
        
        default:
        {
            break;
        }
    }
}
```
