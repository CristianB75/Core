# DRV\_MEMORY\_Tasks Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-E18B0923-4286-4E08-A2EB-9A482E0063AE.md)

## C

```c
void DRV_MEMORY_Tasks( SYS_MODULE_OBJ object );
```

## Summary

Maintains the Memory driver's internal state machine.

## Description

This routine maintains the driver's internal state machine.

Initial state is put to process Queue so that driver can accept<br />transfer requests\(open, erase, read, write, etc\) from client.

This routine is also responsible for checking the status of Erase, Write and read<br />transfer requests and notify the client through transferHandler registered<br />if any.

The state of driver will be busy until transfer is completed. Once transfer<br />is done the state goes back to Process sate until new requests is received.

## Preconditions

The DRV\_MEMORY\_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified Memory driver instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|object|Driver object handle, returned from the DRV\_MEMORY\_Initialize routine|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
SYS_MODULE_OBJ object; // Returned from DRV_MEMORY_Initialize

void SYS_Tasks ( void )
{
    DRV_Memory_Tasks (object);
    // Do other tasks
}
```

## Remarks

This routine is generated only in Asynchronous mode. This routine should not be called directly by application.

-   For Bare Metal it will be called by the system Task routine \(SYS\_Tasks\)

-   For RTOS a separate Thread will be created for this task and will be called in the thread context.
