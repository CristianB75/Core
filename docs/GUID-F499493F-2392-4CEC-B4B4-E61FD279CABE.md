# DRV\_MEMORY\_SyncErase Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-E18B0923-4286-4E08-A2EB-9A482E0063AE.md)

## C

```c
bool DRV_MEMORY_SyncErase
(
    const DRV_HANDLE handle,
    uint32_t blockStart,
    uint32_t nBlock
);
```

## Summary

Erase the specified number of memory blocks in Synchronous mode.

## Description

This function schedules a blocking sector erase operation for<br />the specified number of memory blocks from the specified block start<br />start address on attached memory device.

## Preconditions

The DRV\_MEMORY\_Open\(\) must have been called with DRV\_IO\_INTENT\_WRITE or DRV\_IO\_INTENT\_READWRITE as a parameter to obtain a valid opened device handle.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open function|
|blockStart|block start from where the blocks should be erased.|
|nBlock|Total number of blocks to be erased.|

## Returns

-   true

    -   If the transfer request is successfully completed.

-   false

    -   If the client opened the driver for read only

    -   If the number of blocks to be erased is either zero or more than the number of blocks actually available

    -   If the driver handle is invalid


## Example

```c
// Use DRV_MEMORY_GeometryGet () to find the erase region geometry.
uint32_t blockStart = 0;
uint32_t nBlocks = 10;

// memoryHandle is the handle returned by the DRV_MEMORY_Open function.

if(DRV_MEMORY_SyncErase( memoryHandle, blockStart, nBlock ) == false)
{
    // Error handling here
}

```

## Remarks

This API is supported only in RTOS environment..
