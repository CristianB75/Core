## C

```c
typedef SYS_MEDIA_BLOCK_COMMAND_HANDLE SYS_FS_MEDIA_BLOCK_COMMAND_HANDLE;

```

## Summary

Handle identifying block commands of the media.

## Description

A block command handle is returned by a call to the Read, Write, or Erase<br />functions. This handle allows the application to track the completion of<br />the operation. The handle is returned back to the client by the "event<br />handler callback" function registered with the driver.

The handle assigned to a client request expires when the client has been<br />notified of the completion of the operation \(after event handler function<br />that notifies the client returns\) or after the buffer has been retired by<br />the driver if no event handler callback was set.

## Remarks

Refer to sys\_media.h for actual definition.
