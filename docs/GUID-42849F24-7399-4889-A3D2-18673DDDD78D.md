# DRV\_MX25L\_Close Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-410DBBCC-D224-45B2-B881-7BFB0DFF0EFC.md)

## C

```c
void DRV_MX25L_Close( const DRV_HANDLE handle );
```

## Summary

Closes an opened-instance of the MX25L driver

## Description

This routine closes an opened-instance of the MX25L driver, invalidating<br />the handle.

## Precondition

DRV\_MX25L\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|

## Returns

None

## Example

```c
DRV_HANDLE handle; // Returned from DRV_MX25L_Open

DRV_MX25L_Close(handle);
```

## Remarks

After calling this routine, the handle passed in "handle" must not be used with any of the remaining driver routines.

A new handle must be obtained by calling DRV\_MX25L\_Open before the caller may use the driver again.

Usually there is no need for the driver client to verify that the Close operation has completed.
