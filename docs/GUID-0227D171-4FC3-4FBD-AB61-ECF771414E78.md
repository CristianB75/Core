**Parent topic:**[Common System Services Library](GUID-B6B51E48-2D3D-42F8-8493-3405F1639A9E.md)

## C

```c
typedef uintptr_t SYS_MODULE_OBJ;

```

## Summary

Handle to an instance of a system module.

## Description

This data type is a handle to a specific instance of a system module \(such<br />as a device driver\).

## Remarks

Code outside of a specific module should consider this as an opaque type \(much like a void \*\). Do not make any assumptions about base type as it may change in the future or about the value stored in a variable of this type.
