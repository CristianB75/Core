```

## Summary

Contains all the geometrical information of a media device.

## Description

This structure contains all the geometrical information of a media device.<br />the structure also has property of the media like media is one time<br />programmable \(OTP\) or Read Only etc.

## Remarks

A memory device can have multiple erase block regions. Sum of all the regions is the total memory size of the device.
