# DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_SkipBlock\_BlockRead Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-B826AB75-F4E4-4A5B-8189-23C99CCF9936.md)

## C

```c
bool DRV_NAND_FLASH_SkipBlock_BlockRead(const DRV_HANDLE handle, uint16_t blockNum, uint8_t *data, bool disableBlockCheck)
```

## Summary

Reads the data of a whole block from NAND Flash.

## Description

This function schedules a blocking operation for reading the data of a whole block from NAND Flash.

## Precondition

The DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_Open\(\) routine must have been called for the specified NAND FLASH driver instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|
|blockNum|Block number to read|
|data|Pointer to destination data buffer|
|disableBlockCheck|0 - Block will be checked as good before reading a given block. 1 - Block will not check before reading a given block.|

## Returns

*true* - If Block read is successfully completed

*false* - If Block read fails

## Example

```c
DRV_HANDLE handle; // Returned from DRV_NAND_FLASH_Open
uint16_t blockNum = 3;
static uint8_t blockBuffer[262144 + 14336];

if (DRV_NAND_FLASH_SkipBlock_BlockRead(handle, blockNum, blockBuffer, 0))
{
    // Block read successfully completed
}

```

## Remarks

This routine will block waiting until read request is completed successfully.
