# DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_SkipBlock\_BlockWrite Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-B826AB75-F4E4-4A5B-8189-23C99CCF9936.md)

## C

```c
bool DRV_NAND_FLASH_SkipBlock_BlockWrite(const DRV_HANDLE handle, uint16_t blockNum, uint8_t *data, bool disableBlockCheck)
```

## Summary

Writes the data of a whole block to NAND Flash.

## Description

This function schedules a blocking operation for writing the data of a whole block to NAND Flash.

## Precondition

The DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_Open\(\) routine must have been called for the specified NAND FLASH driver instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|
|blockNum|Block number to write|
|data|Pointer to source data buffer|
|disableBlockCheck|0 - Block will be checked as good before writing a given block. 1 - Block will not check before writing a given block.|

## Returns

*true* - If Block write is successfully completed

*false* - If Block write fails

## Example

```c
DRV_HANDLE handle; // Returned from DRV_NAND_FLASH_Open
uint16_t blockNum = 3;
static uint8_t blockBuffer[262144 + 14336];

memset(blockBuffer, 0x55, sizeof(blockBuffer));

if (DRV_NAND_FLASH_SkipBlock_BlockWrite(handle, blockNum, blockBuffer, 0))
{
    // Block write successfully completed
}

```

## Remarks

This routine will block wait until write request is submitted successfully. Client should wait until write is complete to send next transfer request.
