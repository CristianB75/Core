**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-42556FDF-A632-49FE-8A5E-9303A926578C.md)

## C

```c
SYS_FS_RESULT SYS_FS_FileSync
(
    SYS_FS_HANDLE handle
);
```

## Summary

Flushes the cached information when writing to a file.

## Description

This function flushes the cached information when writing to a file. The<br />SYS\_FS\_FileSync function performs the same process as SYS\_FS\_FileClose<br />function; however, the file is left open and can continue read/write/seek<br />operations to the file.

## Precondition

A valid file handle has to be passed as input to the function. The file which has to be flushed, has to be present and should have been opened in write mode.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|valid file handle|

## Returns

*SYS\_FS\_RES\_SUCCESS* - File sync operation was successful.

*SYS\_FS\_RES\_FAILURE* - File sync operation was unsuccessful. The reason<br />for the failure can be retrieved with SYS\_FS\_Error or SYS\_FS\_FileError.

## Example

```c
SYS_FS_RESULT res;
SYS_FS_HANDLE fileHandle;
const char *buf = "Hello World";
size_t nbytes;
size_t bytes_written;

fileHandle = SYS_FS_FileOpen("/mnt/myDrive/FILE.txt", (SYS_FS_FILE_OPEN_WRITE));

if(fileHandle != SYS_FS_HANDLE_INVALID)
{
    // File open is successful
}

// Write data to the file
bytes_written = SYS_FS_FileWrite(fileHandle, (const void *)buf, nbytes);

// Flush the file
res = SYS_FS_FileSync(fileHandle);

if( res != SYS_FS_RES_SUCCESS)
{
    // Sync failed
}
```

## Remarks

None.
