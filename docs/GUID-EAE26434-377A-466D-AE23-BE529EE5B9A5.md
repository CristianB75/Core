**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-5A5146D2-73C2-43B1-8ADE-95E0184AF1A5.md)

## C

```c
DRV_I2C_TRANSFER_EVENT DRV_I2C_TransferStatusGet(
    const DRV_I2C_TRANSFER_HANDLE transferHandle
)
```

## Summary

Returns the status of the write/read/write-read transfer request.

## Description

This function can be used to poll the status of the queued transfer request<br />if the application doesn't prefer to use the event handler \(callback\)<br />function to get notified.

## Precondition

DRV\_I2C\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

Either the DRV\_I2C\_ReadTransferAdd, DRV\_I2C\_WriteTransferAdd or DRV\_I2C\_WriteReadTransferAdd function must have been called and a valid buffer handle returned.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|transferHandle|Handle for the buffer of which the processed number of bytes to be obtained.|

## Returns

The success or error event of the transfer.

## Example

```c
uint8_t myBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
DRV_I2C_TRANSFER_HANDLE transferHandle;
DRV_I2C_TRANSFER_EVENT event;

// myI2CHandle is the handle returned
// by the DRV_I2C_Open function.

DRV_I2C_ReadTransferAdd(myI2CHandle, slaveAddress, myBuffer, MY_BUFFER_SIZE, &transferHandle);

if(transferHandle == DRV_I2C_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID)
{
    // Error handling here
}

//Check the status of the transfer
//This call can be used to wait until the transfer is processed.

event = DRV_I2C_TransferStatusGet(transferHandle);
```

## Remarks

This function is available only in the asynchronous mode.
