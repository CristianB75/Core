**Parent topic:**[Common System Services Library](GUID-B6B51E48-2D3D-42F8-8493-3405F1639A9E.md)

## C

```c
typedef SYS_MODULE_OBJ (* SYS_MODULE_INITIALIZE_ROUTINE) ( const SYS_MODULE_INDEX index,

```

## Summary

Pointer to a routine that initializes a system module \(driver, library, or system-maintained application\).

## Description

This data type is a pointer to a routine that initializes a system module<br />\(driver, library, or system-maintained application\).

## Precondition

The low-level board initialization must have \(and will be\) completed before the system will call the initialization routine for any modules.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|index|Identifier for the module instance to be initialized|
|init|Pointer to the data structure containing any data necessary to initialize the module. This pointer may be null if no data is required and default initialization is to be used.|

## Returns

A handle to the instance of the system module that was initialized. This handle is a necessary parameter to all of the other system-module level routines for that module.

## Remarks

This function will only be called once during system initialization.
