# DRV\_SPI\_WriteTransferAdd Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-2960D7B8-65FA-447F-AD81-B1E62002A04B.md)

## C

```c
void DRV_SPI_WriteTransferAdd
(
    const DRV_HANDLE handle,
    void* pTransmitData,
    size_t txSize,
    DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_HANDLE * const transferHandle
);
```

## Summary

Queues a write operation.

## Description

This function schedules a non-blocking write operation. The function<br />returns with a valid transfer handle in the transferHandle argument if<br />the request was scheduled successfully. The function adds the request to<br />the instance specific software queue and returns immediately. While the<br />request is in the queue, the application buffer is owned by the driver<br />and should not be modified.<br />This API will write txSize bytes of data and the dummy data received will<br />be ignored.

The function returns DRV\_SPI\_TRANSFER\_HANDLE\_INVALID in the<br />transferHandle argument:

-   if pTransmitData is NULL.

-   if txSize is zero.

-   if the transfer handle is NULL.

-   if the queue size is full or queue depth is insufficient.

-   if the driver handle is invalid.


If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the<br />driver will issue a DRV\_SPI\_TRANSFER\_EVENT\_COMPLETE event if the transfer<br />was processed successfully or DRV\_SPI\_TRANSFER\_EVENT\_ERROR event if the<br />transfer was not processed successfully.

## Precondition

-   DRV\_SPI\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

-   DRV\_SPI\_TransferSetup must have been called if GPIO pin has to be used for


chip select or any of the setup parameters has to be changed dynamically.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|Handle of the communication channel as returned by the DRV\_SPI\_Open function. \*pTransmitData- Pointer to the data which has to be transmitted.|
|txSize|Number of bytes to be transmitted. The size must be specified in terms of the SPI data width. For example, if the data width is 8-bits, and if 10 bytes are being transmitted, then the txSize must be set to 10. If the data width is 16-bits then transmitting 10 bytes requires specifying the txSize as 10 \(meaning 10 16-bit words\).|
|transferHandle|Handle which is returned by transfer add function.|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;
uint8_t myTxBuffer[MY_TX_BUFFER_SIZE];
DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_HANDLE transferHandle;

// mySPIHandle is the handle returned by the DRV_SPI_Open function.

DRV_SPI_WriteTransferAdd(mySPIhandle, myTxBuffer, MY_TX_BUFFER_SIZE, &transferHandle);

if(transferHandle == DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_HANDLE_INVALID)
{
    // Error handling here
}

// Event is received when the transfer is processed.
```

## Remarks

-   This function can be called from within the SPI Driver Transfer Event Handler that is registered by the client.

-   It should NOT be called in the event handler associated with another SPI driver instance or event handler of any other peripheral.

-   It should not be called directly in any ISR.
