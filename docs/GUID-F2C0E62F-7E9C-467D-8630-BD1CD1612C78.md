# DRV\_AT24\_Open Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-354A36E3-7E0B-4DD0-8485-DDFD792B525C.md)

## C

```c
DRV_HANDLE DRV_AT24_Open
(
const SYS_MODULE_INDEX drvIndex,
const DRV_IO_INTENT ioIntent
)
```

## Summary

Opens the specified AT24 driver instance and returns a handle to it.

## Description

This routine opens the specified AT24 driver instance and provides a<br />handle that must be provided to all other client-level operations to<br />identify the caller and the instance of the driver. The ioIntent<br />parameter defines how the client interacts with this driver instance.

This driver is a single client driver, so DRV\_AT24\_Open API should be<br />called only once until driver is closed.

## Precondition

Function DRV\_AT24\_Initialize must have been called before calling this function.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|drvIndex|Identifier for the object instance to be opened|
|ioIntent|Zero or more of the values from the enumeration DRV\_IO\_INTENT "ORed" together to indicate the intended use of the driver. Note: This driver ignores the ioIntent argument.|

## Returns

If successful, the routine returns a valid open-instance handle \(a number identifying both the caller and the module instance\).

If an error occurs, the return value is DRV\_HANDLE\_INVALID. Error can occur

-   if the driver has been already opened once and in use.

-   if the driver instance being opened is not initialized or is invalid.


## Example

```c
DRV_HANDLE handle;

handle = DRV_AT24_Open(DRV_AT24_INDEX, DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE);
if (handle == DRV_HANDLE_INVALID)
{
    // Unable to open the driver
    // May be the driver is not initialized
}
```

## Remarks

The handle returned is valid until the DRV\_AT24\_Close routine is called.
