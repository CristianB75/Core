# DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_SkipBlock\_PageRead Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-B826AB75-F4E4-4A5B-8189-23C99CCF9936.md)

## C

```c
bool DRV_NAND_FLASH_SkipBlock_PageRead(
    const DRV_HANDLE handle,
    uint16_t blockNum,
    uint16_t pageNum,
    uint8_t *data,
    uint8_t *spare,
    bool disableBlockCheck
);
```

## Summary

Reads the data and/or the spare area of a page of given block from NAND Flash.

## Description

This function schedules a blocking operation for reading the data and/or the spare area<br />of a page of given block from NAND Flash.

## Precondition

The DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_Open\(\) routine must have been called for the specified NAND FLASH driver instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|
|blockNum|Block number to read page from|
|pageNum|Page number to read inside the given block|
|data|Pointer to destination data buffer|
|spare|Pointer to destination spare buffer.|
|disableBlockCheck|0 - Block will be checked as good before reading a page. 1 - Block will not check before reading a page.|

## Returns

*true* - If Page read is successfully completed

*false* - If Page read fails

## Example

```c
DRV_HANDLE handle; // Returned from DRV_NAND_FLASH_Open
uint16_t blockNum = 3;
uint16_t pageNum = 0;
static uint8_t pageBuffer[4096 + 224];

if (DRV_NAND_FLASH_SkipBlock_PageRead(handle, blockNum, pageNum, pageBuffer, 0, 0))
{
    // Page read successfully completed
}

```

## Remarks

This routine will block waiting until read request is completed successfully.
