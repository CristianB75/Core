# DRV\_HANDLE Typedef

**Parent topic:**[Common Driver Library](GUID-DFB9A1FE-5BBB-4A10-A4B0-430BA7B9AF94.md)

## C

```c
typedef uintptr_t DRV_HANDLE;

```

## Summary

Handle to an opened device driver.

## Description

This handle identifies the open instance of a device driver. It must be<br />passed to all other driver routines \(except the initialization, deinitialization,<br />or power routines\) to identify the caller.

## Remarks

Every application or module that wants to use a driver must first call the driver's open routine. This is the only routine that is absolutely required for every driver.

If a driver is unable to allow an additional module to use it, it must then return the special value DRV\_HANDLE\_INVALID. Callers should check the handle returned for this value to ensure this value was not returned before attempting to call any other driver routines using the handle.
