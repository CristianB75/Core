# SYS\_FS\_Error Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-42556FDF-A632-49FE-8A5E-9303A926578C.md)

## C

```c
SYS_FS_ERROR SYS_FS_Error( void );
```

## Summary

Returns the last error.

## Description

When a file system operation fails, the application can know the reason<br />of failure by calling the SYS\_FS\_Error. This function only reports the<br />errors which are not file \(or file handle\) specific. For example, for<br />functions such as SYS\_FS\_Mount and SYS\_FS\_FileOpen, which do not take<br />handle, any errors happening inside such function calls could be reported<br />using SYS\_FS\_Error function.

Even for functions, which take handle as its input parameters, the<br />SYS\_FS\_Error function can be used to report the type of error for cases<br />where the passed handle itself is invalid.

## Precondition

This function has to be called immediately after a failure is observed while doing a file operation.

Any subsequent failure will overwrite the cause of previous failure.

## Parameters

None.

## Returns

Error code of type SYS\_FS\_ERROR.

## Example

```c
SYS_FS_HANDLE fileHandle;
SYS_FS_ERROR err;

fileHandle = SYS_FS_FileOpen("/mnt/myDrive/FILE.txt", (SYS_FS_FILE_OPEN_READ));

if(fileHandle == SYS_FS_HANDLE_INVALID)
{
    // If failure, now know the specific reason for failure
    err = SYS_FS_Error();
}
```

## Remarks

None.
