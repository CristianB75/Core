# SYS\_MODULE\_REINITIALIZE\_ROUTINE Typedef

**Parent topic:**[Common System Services Library](GUID-B6B51E48-2D3D-42F8-8493-3405F1639A9E.md)

## C

```c
    typedef void (* SYS_MODULE_REINITIALIZE_ROUTINE) ( SYS_MODULE_OBJ object,

```

## Summary

Pointer to a routine that reinitializes a system module \(driver, library, or system-maintained application\)

## Description

This data type is a pointer to a routine that reinitializes a system<br />module \(driver, library, or system-maintained application\).

## Precondition

The low-level board initialization must have \(and will be\) completed and the module's initialization routine will have been called before the system will call the reinitialization routine for any modules.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|object|Handle to the module instance|
|init|Pointer to the data structure containing any data necessary to initialize the module. This pointer may be null if no data is required and default initialization is to be used.|

## Returns

None.

## Example

None.

## Remarks

This operation uses the same initialization data structure as the Initialize operation.

This operation can be used to refresh the hardware state as defined by the initialization data, thus it must guarantee that all hardware state has been refreshed.

This function can be called multiple times to reinitialize the module.
