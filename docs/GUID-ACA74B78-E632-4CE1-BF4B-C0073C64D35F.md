# DRV\_SST26\_GeometryGet Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-9FCC5D93-AC38-4FA0-88B8-A6C5A9BAF6EF.md)

## C

```c
bool DRV_SST26_GeometryGet( const DRV_HANDLE handle, SST26_GEOMETRY *geometry );
```

## Summary

Returns the geometry of the device.

## Description

This API gives the following geometrical details of the SST26 Flash:

-   Number of Read/Write/Erase Blocks and their size in each region of the device

-   Flash block start address.


## Precondition

The DRV\_SST26\_Open\(\) routine must have been called for the specified SST26 driver instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|
|\*geometry\_table|pointer to flash device geometry table instance|

## Returns

*true* - if able to get the geometry details of the flash

*false* - if read device id fails

## Example

```c
DRV_HANDLE handle; // Returned from DRV_SST26_Open

DRV_SST26_GEOMETRY sst26FlashGeometry;

uint32_t readBlockSize, writeBlockSize, eraseBlockSize;
uint32_t nReadBlocks, nReadRegions, totalFlashSize;

DRV_SST26_GeometryGet(handle, &sst26FlashGeometry);

readBlockSize = sst26FlashGeometry.read_blockSize;
nReadBlocks = sst26FlashGeometry.read_numBlocks;
nReadRegions = sst26FlashGeometry.numReadRegions;

writeBlockSize = sst26FlashGeometry.write_blockSize;
eraseBlockSize = sst26FlashGeometry.erase_blockSize;

totalFlashSize = readBlockSize * nReadBlocks * nReadRegions;

```

## Remarks

This API is more useful when used to interface with Memory driver.
