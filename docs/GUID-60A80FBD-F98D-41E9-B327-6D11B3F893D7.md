# DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_SkipBlock\_BlockErase Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-B826AB75-F4E4-4A5B-8189-23C99CCF9936.md)

## C

```c
bool DRV_NAND_FLASH_SkipBlock_BlockErase(const DRV_HANDLE handle, uint16_t blockNum, bool disableBlockCheck)
```

## Summary

Erase a block.

## Description

This function schedules a blocking block erase operation of flash memory. It erases a given block.

## Preconditions

The DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_Open\(\) routine must have been called for the specified NAND FLASH driver instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|
|blockNum|Block number to be erased|
|disableBlockCheck|0 - Block will be checked as good before erasing a given block. 1 - Block will not check before erasing a given block.|

## Returns

*true* - If the block erase is successfully completed

*false* - If block erase fails

## Example

```c
uint16_t blockNum = 0;
DRV_HANDLE handle; // Returned from DRV_NAND_FLASH_Open

if(DRV_NAND_FLASH_SkipBlock_BlockErase(handle, blockNum, 0))
{
    // Block erase is successfully completed
}

```

## Remarks

This routine will block wait until erase request is completed successfully. Client should wait until erase is complete to send next transfer request.
