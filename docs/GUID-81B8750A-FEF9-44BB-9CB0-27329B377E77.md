**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-6D9FA3F1-00EF-4C4D-AC06-CF95F5137ACB.md)

## C

```c
bool DRV_AT25DF_BlockErase(const DRV_HANDLE handle, uint32_t address);
```

## Summary

Erase a block from the specified block start address.

## Description

This function schedules a non-blocking block erase operation of flash memory.<br />The block size is 64 KByte.

The requesting client should call DRV\_AT25DF\_TransferStatusGet\(\) API to know<br />the current status of the request.

## Preconditions

The DRV\_AT25DF\_Open\(\) routine must have been called for the specified AT25DF driver instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|
|address|block start address to be erased.|

## Returns

*true*

-   if the erase request is successfully sent to the flash


*false*

-   if Write enable fails before sending sector erase command to flash

-   if block erase command itself fails


## Example

```c
DRV_HANDLE handle; // Returned from DRV_AT25DF_Open
uint32_t blockStart = 0;

if(DRV_AT25DF_BlockErase(handle, blockStart) == false)
{
    // Error handling here
}

// Wait for erase to be completed
while(DRV_AT25DF_TransferStatusGet(handle) == DRV_AT25DF_TRANSFER_STATUS_BUSY);

```

## Remarks

This routine will block wait until erase request is submitted successfully.

Client should wait until erase is complete to send next transfer request.
