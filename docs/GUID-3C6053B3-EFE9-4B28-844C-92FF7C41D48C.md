```c
typedef enum

    /* Transfer request is pending */
    DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_EVENT_PENDING ,

    /* All data were transfered successfully. */
    DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_EVENT_COMPLETE ,

    /* Transfer Handle given is expired. It means transfer
    is completed but with or without error is not known.
    In case of Non-DMA transfer, since there is no possibility
    of error, it can be assumed same as DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_EVENT_COMPLETE */
    DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_EVENT_HANDLE_EXPIRED ,

    /* There was an error while processing transfer request. */
    DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_EVENT_ERROR ,

    /* Transfer Handle given is invalid */
    DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_EVENT_HANDLE_INVALID

} DRV_SPI_TRANSFER_EVENT;

```

## Summary

Identifies the possible events that can result from a transfer add request.

## Description

This enumeration identifies the possible events that can result from a<br />transfer add request caused by the client calling either<br />DRV\_SPI\_ReadTransferAdd or DRV\_SPI\_WriteTransferAdd or<br />DRV\_SPI\_WriteReadTransferAdd functions.

## Remarks

Either DRV\_SPI\_TRANSFER\_EVENT\_COMPLETE or DRV\_SPI\_TRANSFER\_EVENT\_ERROR is passed in the "event" parameter of the event handling callback function that the client registered with the driver by calling the DRV\_SPI\_TransferEventHandlerSet function when a transfer request is completed.

When status polling is used, any one of these events is returned by DRV\_SPI\_TransferStatusGet function.
