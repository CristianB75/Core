The SPI Driver is a multi-client, multi-instance buffer model based driver interface which can be used to communicate with various slave devices like EEPROM, ADC etc.

**Key Features of SPI Driver:**

-   **Multi Client:** Each instance of SPI driver can have multiple clients. This means the SPI driver supports multiple slaves connected to the same SPI bus.

-   **Multi Instance:** Provides interface to manage multiple instances of SPI peripheral.

-   Supports Asynchronous and Synchronous modes of operation.

-   Supports Bare Metal and RTOS environments.
