SYS_TIME_RESULT SYS_TIME_TimerDestroy ( SYS_TIME_HANDLE handle)
```

## Summary

Destroys/deallocates a software timer instance.

## Description

This function deletes and deallocates a software timer instance,<br />stopping its counter and releasing the associated resources.

## Precondition

The SYS\_TIME\_Initialize and a valid handle to the software timer to be destroyed must be available.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|Handle to a software timer instance.|

## Returns

*SYS\_TIME\_SUCCESS* - If the given software was successfully destroyed.

*SYS\_TIME\_ERROR* - If an error occured or the given handle was invalid.

## Example

```c
// "timer" is the handle to the software timer to be destroyed.
if (SYS_TIME_TimerDestroy(timer) != SYS_TIME_SUCCESS)
