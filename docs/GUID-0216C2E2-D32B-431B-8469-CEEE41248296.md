# SYS\_TIME\_FrequencyGet Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-3D84F884-122D-4A4A-95DA-DFD8C2E84650.md)

## C

```c
uint32_t SYS_TIME_FrequencyGet ( void )
```

## Summary

Gets the frequency at which the hardwaer timer counts.

## Description

For tick-less mode this API returns the frequency at which the hardware<br />timer runs.<br />For tick-based mode, this API returns the frequency at which the hardware<br />timer generates a periodic tick.<br />This frequency determines the maximum resolution of all<br />services provided by SYS\_TIME.

## Precondition

The SYS\_TIME\_Initialize function should have been called before calling this function.

## Parameters

None

## Returns

If the timer has been initialized and is ready:

-   For tick-less mode this API returns the frequency at which the hardware timer runs.

-   For tick-based mode, this API returns the frequency at which the hardware timer generates a periodic tick.


Returns 0 if the timer is not initialized.

## Example

```c
uint32_t frequency = SYS_TIME_FrequencyGet();
```

## Remarks

This frequency is determined by hardware capabilities and how they are configured and initialized.
