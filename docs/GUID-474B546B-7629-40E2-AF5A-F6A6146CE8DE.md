# AT25DF Driver

This driver provides a non-blocking interface to read, write and erase AT25DF Flash memory. The library uses the SPI peripheral library \(PLIB\) to interface with the AT25DF

**Key Features:**

-   Supports Multiple variants of the AT25DF Flash devices

-   Supports a single instance of the AT25DF Flash and a single client to the driver

-   Supports Sector/Bulk/Chip Erase Operations

-   Supports writes to random memory address within page boundaries

-   The library interface is compliant to the block media interface expected by the **Memory Driver**. This allows running a file system on the AT25DF Flash using the Memory Driver and the File System Service

-   The library can be used in both Bare-Metal and RTOS environments
