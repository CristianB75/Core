**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-42556FDF-A632-49FE-8A5E-9303A926578C.md)

## C

```c
size_t SYS_FS_FileWrite
(
    SYS_FS_HANDLE handle,
    const void *buf,
    size_t nbyte
);
```

## Summary

Writes data to the file.

## Description

This function attempts to write nbyte bytes from the buffer pointed to by<br />buf to the file associated with the file handle.

## Precondition

A valid file handle must be obtained before writing a file.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|File handle obtained during file open.|
|buf|Pointer to buffer from which data is to be written|
|nbyte|Number of bytes to be written|

## Returns

*On success* - returns the number of bytes written successfully\(0 or positive<br />number\).

*On failure* - returns -1. The reason for the failure can be retrieved with<br />SYS\_FS\_Error or SYS\_FS\_FileError.

## Example

```c
SYS_FS_HANDLE fileHandle;
const char *buf = "Hello World";
size_t nbytes;
size_t bytes_written;

fileHandle = SYS_FS_FileOpen("/mnt/myDrive/FILE.txt", (SYS_FS_FILE_OPEN_WRITE));

if(fileHandle != SYS_FS_HANDLE_INVALID)
{
    // File open is successful
}

// Write data to the file
bytes_written = SYS_FS_FileWrite(fileHandle, (const void *)buf, nbytes);
```

## Remarks

None.
