# DRV\_I2C\_ReadTransfer Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-5A5146D2-73C2-43B1-8ADE-95E0184AF1A5.md)

## C

```c
bool DRV_I2C_ReadTransfer(
    const DRV_HANDLE handle,
    uint16_t address,
    void* const buffer,
    const size_t size
)
```

## Summary

This is a blocking function that performs a I2C read operation.

## Description

This function does a blocking read operation. The function blocks till<br />the read is complete or error has occurred during read. Function will<br />return false to report failure.

The failure will occur for the following reasons:

-   Invalid input parameters

-   Hardware error


## Precondition

DRV\_I2C\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine DRV\_I2C\_Open function.|
|address|Slave Address|
|buffer|Destination buffer where read data is stored.|
|size|Size in bytes of data to be read.|

## Returns

*true* - read is successful

*false* - error has occurred

## Example

```c
uint8_t myRxBuffer[MY_RX_BUFFER_SIZE];

// myI2CHandle is the handle returned
// by the DRV_I2C_Open function.

// slaveAddress is address of I2C slave device
// to which data is to be written

if (DRV_I2C_ReadTransfer(myI2CHandle, slaveAddress, myRxBuffer, MY_RX_BUFFER_SIZE) == false)
{
    // Error handling here
}

```

## Remarks

This function is thread safe in a RTOS application. This function should not be called from an interrupt context. This function is available only in the synchronous mode.
