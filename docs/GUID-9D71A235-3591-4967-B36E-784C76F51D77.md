# DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_TransferStatusGet Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-B826AB75-F4E4-4A5B-8189-23C99CCF9936.md)

## C

```c
DRV_NAND_FLASH_TRANSFER_STATUS DRV_NAND_FLASH_TransferStatusGet(const DRV_HANDLE handle)
```

## Summary

Gets the current status of the transfer request.

## Description

This routine gets the current status of the transfer request. The application<br />must use this routine where the status of a scheduled request needs to be<br />polled on.

## Preconditions

The DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_Open\(\) routine must have been called for the specified NAND FLASH driver instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|

## Returns

DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_TRANSFER\_ERROR\_UNKNOWN - If invalid handle

DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_TRANSFER\_BUSY - If the current transfer request is still being processed

DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_TRANSFER\_COMPLETED - If the transfer request is completed DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_TRANSFER\_FAIL - If the transfer is failed

## Example

```c
DRV_HANDLE handle; // Returned from DRV_NAND_FLASH_Open

if (DRV_NAND_FLASH_TRANSFER_COMPLETED == DRV_NAND_FLASH_TransferStatusGet(handle))
{
    // Operation Done
}
```

## Remarks

This routine will block wait for hardware access.
