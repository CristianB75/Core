# How the Library Works

The NAND flash driver library is a single-client, single-instance based driver interface.

**Abstraction Model**

The NAND Flash driver interface provides read, write and erase functions that abstract out the internal workings of the NAND Flash driver and the underlying External Bus Interface \(EBI\)/NAND Flash Controller.

**Working flow**

-   The NAND Flash Driver performs initialization and puts the driver to ready state. This status of the driver can be checked using DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_Status\(\)

-   The NAND Flash driver library performs set of flash operations during DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_Open\(\). If any of the below flash operations fails, an invalid Handle will be returned. DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_Open\(\) can be repeatedly called until it returns a valid handle.

    -   Resets the NAND Flash device

    -   Reads the Parameter page of the NAND Flash device

    -   Setup the PMECC descriptor if PMECC enabled

-   The NAND Flash driver library reads NAND Flash geometry using DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_GeometryGet\(\).

-   The NAND Flash driver library performs a block erase using DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_SkipBlock\_BlockErase\(\).

-   The NAND Flash driver library performs a page and block write using DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_SkipBlock\_PageWrite\(\) and DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_SkipBlock\_BlockWrite\(\) respectively.

-   The NAND Flash driver library performs a page and block read using DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_SkipBlock\_PageRead\(\) and DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_SkipBlock\_BlockRead\(\) respectively.
