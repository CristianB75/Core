# File System Service

The MPLAB Harmony File System Service \(SYS\_FS\) provides an application programming interface \(API\) through which a utility or user program requests services of a file system. Some file system APIs may also include interfaces for maintenance operations, such as creating or initializing a file system and verifying the file system for integrity.

The File System service is really a framework designed to support multiple file systems **\(native file system\)** and multiple media in the same application. Examples of native file systems are FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, exFAT, the Microchip File System \(MPFS\) and littleFS.

**MPFS** is a read-only file system, which is used to store the files that do not change for example Web pages, images, etc. Each of these native file systems have a common set of APIs that can be used to access the files of that particular native file system.

File system features include the following:

-   Support for multiple file system \(FAT, MPFS, littleFS\)

-   Supports multiple physical media \(NVM, SPI/QSPI FLASH, SPI/I2C EEPROM, SD card, eMMC, USB Host MSD, RAM\)

-   More physical media can be interfaced with the FS, once the driver is available for the media

-   Modular and Layered architecture
