# DRV\_CLIENT\_STATUS Enum

**Parent topic:**[Common Driver Library](GUID-DFB9A1FE-5BBB-4A10-A4B0-430BA7B9AF94.md)

## C

```c
typedef enum
{
    /* Indicates that a driver-specific error has occurred. */
    DRV_CLIENT_STATUS_ERROR_EXTENDED = -10,

    /* An unspecified error has occurred.*/
    DRV_CLIENT_STATUS_ERROR = -1,

    /* The driver is closed, no operations for this client are ongoing,
    and/or the given handle is invalid. */
    DRV_CLIENT_STATUS_CLOSED = 0,

    /* The driver is currently busy and cannot start additional operations. */
    DRV_CLIENT_STATUS_BUSY = 1,

    /* The module is running and ready for additional operations */
    DRV_CLIENT_STATUS_READY = 2,

    /* Indicates that the module is in a driver-specific ready/run state. */
    DRV_CLIENT_STATUS_READY_EXTENDED = 10

} DRV_CLIENT_STATUS;

```

## Summary

Identifies the current status/state of a client's connection to a driver.

## Description

This enumeration identifies the current status/state of a client's link to<br />a driver.

## Remarks

The enumeration used as the return type for the client-level status routines defined by each device driver or system module \(for example, DRV\_USART\_ClientStatus\) must be based on the values in this enumeration.
