# Using The Library

The I2C bit bang library supports the following I2C transfers:

-   Master Write: The master writes a block of data to the slave

-   Master Read: The master reads a block of data from the slave

-   Master Write/Read: The master writes and then reads back a block of data from slave.


The I2C Bit bang library can be directly used by application or can be used with I2C driver to perform read and write operations

**Example application to write using callback method**

```c
#define APP_SLAVE_ADDR 0x0057
#define NUM_BYTES      10

uint8_t myWriteData [NUM_BYTES] = {'1', '0', ' ', 'B', 'Y', 'T', 'E', 'S', '!', '!',};

void I2C_BB_Callback(uintptr_t context)
{
    if(I2C_BB_ErrorGet() == I2CBB_ERROR_NONE)
    {
        //Transfer is completed successfully
    }
    else
    {
        //Error occurred during transfer.
    }
}

int main(void)
{
    /* Register Callback function */
    I2C_BB_CallbackRegister(I2C_BB_Callback, (uintptr_t)NULL);

    /* Submit Write Request */
    I2C_BB_Write(APP_SLAVE_ADDR, &myWriteData[0], NUM_BYTES);

    /* Perform other tasks. The I2C_BB_Callback will be called when the write transfer is complete */
}

```
