# SYS\_TIME\_TimerStart Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-3D84F884-122D-4A4A-95DA-DFD8C2E84650.md)

## C

```c
SYS_TIME_RESULT SYS_TIME_TimerStart ( SYS_TIME_HANDLE handle )
```

## Summary

Starts a software timer running.

## Description

This function starts a previously created software timer.

## Precondition

The SYS\_TIME\_Initialize must have been called and a valid handle to the software timer to be started must be available.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|Handle to a software timer instance.|

## Returns

SYS\_TIME\_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds.

SYS\_TIME\_ERROR if the operation fails \(due, for example, to an to an invalid handle\).

## Example

Given a "timer" handle, the following example will start the timer's counter running.

```c
SYS_TIME_TimerStart(timer);
```

## Remarks

Calling SYS\_TIME\_TimerStart on an already running timer will have no affect and will return SYS\_TIME\_SUCCESS.

Calling SYS\_TIME\_TimerStart on a timer that is stopped, will always restart the timer from it's initial configured timer/counter value and will not resume the timer from the counter value at which it was stopped.
