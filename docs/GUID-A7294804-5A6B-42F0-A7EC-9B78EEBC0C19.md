## Summary

Specifes the partitioning rule.

## Description

This type specifies the partitioning rule.

-   When SYS\_FS\_FORMAT\_FAT is specified, a primary partition occupying the<br />entire disk space is created and then an FAT volume is created on the partition.

    -   It is usually used for hard disk, MMC, SDC, CFC and U Disk. It can divide<br />a physical drive into one or more partitions with a partition table on the MBR.<br />However Windows does not support multiple partition on the removable media.

-   When SYS\_FS\_FORMAT\_SFD format is specified, the FAT volume starts from the<br />first sector of the physical drive.

    -   It is non-partitioned method. The FAT volume starts from the first sector<br />on the physical drive without partition table. It is usually used for floppy disk,<br />micro drive, optical disk, and super-floppy media.

-   When SYS\_FS\_FORMAT\_ANY format is specified FAT FS code decides on the format.
