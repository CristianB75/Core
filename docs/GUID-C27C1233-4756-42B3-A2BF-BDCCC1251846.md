# How the Library Works

The MX25L driver library is a single-client, single-instance based driver interface.

**Abstraction Model**

The MX25L driver interface provides read, write and Erase functions that abstract out the internal workings of the MX25L driver and the underlying QSPI protocol.

The client can be:

-   Application - Directly access the MX25L Flash using the APIs provided by the MX25L Driver library

-   Memory Driver - Application can run a file system on the MX25L Flash by connecting it to the Memory Driver which can further be connected to the File System Service

**Working flow**

-   The MX25L Driver performs initialization and puts the driver to ready state. This status of the driver can be checked using **DRV\_MX25L\_Status\(\)**

-   The MX25L driver library performs set of flash operations during **DRV\_MX25L\_Initialize\(\)**

    -   Resets the Flash

    -   Configures the flash device to QUAD IO Mode if underlying peripheral library is running in QSPI/SQI mode

    -   Unlocks the flash if it has been opened in write mode

-   When the client requests for device geometry, it queries for the JEDEC-Id and populates the geometry table DRV\_MX25L\_GEOMETRY appropriately.

-   The driver does not support queuing of more than one requests. The application must check and ensure that any previous request is completed before submitting a new one. This can be done by polling the status of data transfer using **DRV\_MX25L\_TransferStatusGet\(\)**
