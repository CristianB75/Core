# DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_SkipBlock\_BlockTag Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-B826AB75-F4E4-4A5B-8189-23C99CCF9936.md)

## C

```c
bool DRV_NAND_FLASH_SkipBlock_BlockTag(const DRV_HANDLE handle, uint16_t blockNum, bool badBlock)
```

## Summary

Tag NAND Flash block to bad or good.

## Description

This routine tags given block of NAND Flash device to bad or good.

## Preconditions

The DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_Open\(\) routine must have been called for the specified NAND FLASH driver instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|
|blockNum|Block number to be tagged|
|badBlock|1 - Block to be tagged as bad block. 0 - If block to be tagged as good block.|

## Returns

*true* - If given block is tagged as bad or good

*false* - If failed to tag a block

## Example

```c
uint16_t blockNum = 0;
DRV_HANDLE handle; // Returned from DRV_NAND_FLASH_Open

if (DRV_NAND_FLASH_SkipBlock_BlockTag(handle, blockNum, 1))
// Block is tagged as bad
}
```

## Remarks

This routine will block for hardware access.
