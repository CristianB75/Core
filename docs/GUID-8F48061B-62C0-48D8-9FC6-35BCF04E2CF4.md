```c
void DRV_USART_Close( DRV_Handle handle )

## Precondition

DRV\_USART\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|

## Returns

None.

## Example

```c
// 'handle', returned from the DRV_USART_Open

DRV_USART_Close(handle);

```
