# DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_GeometryGet Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-B826AB75-F4E4-4A5B-8189-23C99CCF9936.md)

## C

```c
bool DRV_NAND_FLASH_GeometryGet( const DRV_HANDLE handle, DRV_NAND_FLASH_GEOMETRY *geometry );
```

## Summary

Returns the geometry of the NAND Flash device.

## Description

This API gives the following geometrical details of the NAND Flash:

-   deviceId \(JEDEC Manufacturer ID\)

-   Bus Width

-   Number of data bytes per page

-   Number of spare bytes per page

-   Block Size

-   Device Size

-   Number of logical units

-   Number of bits of ECC correction


## Precondition

The DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_Open\(\) routine must have been called for the specified NAND FLASH driver instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|
|geometry|Pointer to destination geometry buffer into which geometry to be placed|

## Returns

*true* - If geometry is successfully read from the NAND Flash

*false* - If geometry read is failed

## Example

```c
DRV_HANDLE handle; // Returned from DRV_NAND_FLASH_Open
DRV_NAND_FLASH_GEOMETRY nandFlashFlashGeometry;

if (DRV_NAND_FLASH_GeometryGet(handle, &nandFlashFlashGeometry))
{
    // Geometry read successfully
}
```

## Remarks

This routine will block wait for hardware access.
