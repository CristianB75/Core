# SST26 Driver

This driver provides a non-blocking interface to read, write and erase SST26 Flash memory. The driver uses the below peripheral library to interface with the SST26 Flash.

-   QSPI Peripheral Library

    -   Supports both SPI mode and Quad IO Mode

-   SPI Peripheral Library

    -   Supports only SPI mode

-   SQI peripheral Library

    -   Supports Quad Lane Mode and Single Lane Mode


**Key Features:**

-   Supports Multiple variants of the SST26 Flash devices

-   Supports a single instance of the SST26 Flash and a single client to the driver

-   Supports Sector/Bulk/Chip Erase Operations

-   Supports writes to random memory address within page boundaries

-   The library interface is compliant to the block media interface expected by the **Memory Driver**. This allows running a file system on the AT25DF Flash using the Memory Driver and the File System Service

-   The library can be used in both Bare-Metal and RTOS environments
