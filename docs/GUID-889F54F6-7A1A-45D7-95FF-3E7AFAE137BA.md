# DRV\_USART\_ReadBuffer Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-80FC4C27-64D2-411F-BE4A-4C4A8BD80604.md)

## C

```c
bool DRV_USART_ReadBuffer
(
    const DRV_HANDLE handle,
    void* buffer,
    const size_t size
);
```

## Summary

This is a blocking function that reads data over USART.

## Description

This function does a blocking read operation. The function blocks till<br />the data read is complete or error has occurred during read.<br />Function will return false to report failure. The failure will occur for<br />the following reasons:

-   if the handle is invalid

-   if the input buffer pointer is NULL

-   if the buffer size is 0

-   Hardware errors


## Precondition

DRV\_USART\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|Handle of the communication channel as return by the DRV\_USART\_Open function.|
|buffer|Pointer to the receive buffer.|
|size|Buffer size in bytes.|

## Returns

*true* - read is successful

*false* - error has occurred

## Example

```c
MY_APP_OBJ myAppObj;
uint8_t myBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];

// myUSARTHandle is the handle returned
// by the DRV_USART_Open function.

if (DRV_USART_ReadBuffer(myUSARTHandle, myBuffer, MY_BUFFER_SIZE) == false)
{
    // Error handling here
}
```

## Remarks

This function is thread safe in a RTOS application. This function should not be called from an interrupt context.
