# SYS\_TIME\_MSToCount Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-3D84F884-122D-4A4A-95DA-DFD8C2E84650.md)

## C

```c
uint32_t SYS_TIME_MSToCount ( uint32_t ms )
```

## Summary

Convert the given time interval in milliseconds to an equivalent counter value.

## Description

This function converts a given time interval \(measured in milliseconds\) to<br />an equivalent 32-bit counter value, based on the configured hardware timer<br />frequency as reported by SYS\_TIME\_FrequencyGet.

## Precondition

The SYS\_TIME\_Initialize function should have been called before calling this function.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|ms|Time interval in milliseconds.|

## Returns

Number of hardware timer counts that will expire in the given time interval.

## Example

```c
uint32_t futureCounter = SYS_TIME_CounterGet() + SYS_TIME_MSToCount(10);
```

## Remarks

In tick-based mode, the returned count will be ceiled to the next timer tick. For example, if the timer tick is set to 700 usec and the requested time is 2 msec, a count of 3 will be reported \(corresponding to 2.1 msec\).
