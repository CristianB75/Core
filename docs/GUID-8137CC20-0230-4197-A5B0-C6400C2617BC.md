## C

```c
void DRV_MEMORY_Close( const DRV_HANDLE handle );
```

## Summary

Closes an opened-instance of the Memory driver

## Description

This routine closes an opened-instance of the Memory driver, invalidating<br />the handle.

After calling this routine, the handle passed in "handle" must not be used<br />with any of the remaining driver routines. A new handle must be obtained by<br />calling DRV\_MEMORY\_Open before the caller may use the driver again. Usually<br />there is no need for the driver client to verify that the Close operation<br />has completed.

## Precondition

DRV\_MEMORY\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|

## Returns

None

## Example

```c
DRV_HANDLE handle; // Returned from DRV_MEMORY_Open

DRV_MEMORY_Close(handle);
```

## Remarks

None.
