## C

```c
typedef enum
{
    /* Transfer request is pending */
    DRV_I2C_TRANSFER_EVENT_PENDING = 0,

    /* All data from or to the buffer was transferred successfully. */
    DRV_I2C_TRANSFER_EVENT_COMPLETE = 1,

    /* Transfer Handle given is expired. It means transfer
    is completed but with or without error is not known. */
    DRV_I2C_TRANSFER_EVENT_HANDLE_EXPIRED = 2,

    /* There was an error while processing the buffer transfer request. */
    DRV_I2C_TRANSFER_EVENT_ERROR = -1,

    DRV_I2C_TRANSFER_EVENT_HANDLE_INVALID = -2

} DRV_I2C_TRANSFER_EVENT;

```

## Summary

Identifies the possible events that can result from a buffer add request.

## Description

This enumeration identifies the possible events that can result from a<br />buffer add request caused by the client calling either the<br />DRV\_I2C\_ReadTransferAdd, DRV\_I2C\_WriteTransferAdd or<br />DRV\_I2C\_WriteReadTransferAdd functions.

## Remarks

One of these values is passed in the "event" parameter of the event handling callback function that the client registered with the driver by calling the DRV\_I2C\_TransferEventHandlerSet function when a buffer transfer request is completed.
