# DRV\_AT25\_GeometryGet Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-FC2766BD-E5AF-4007-BA9A-D1E179E8AF51.md)

## C

```c
bool DRV_AT25_GeometryGet(const DRV_HANDLE handle, DRV_AT25_GEOMETRY *geometry)
```

## Summary

Returns the geometry of the device.

## Description

This API gives the following geometrical details of the DRV\_AT25 Flash:

-   Number of Read/Write/Erase Blocks and their size in each region of the device


## Precondition

DRV\_AT25\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|
|geometry|Pointer to flash device geometry table instance|

## Returns

*true* - if able to get the geometry details of the flash

*false* - if handle is invalid

## Example

```c
DRV_AT25_GEOMETRY eepromGeometry;
uint32_t readBlockSize, writeBlockSize, eraseBlockSize;
uint32_t nReadBlocks, nReadRegions, totalFlashSize;

// myHandle is the handle returned from DRV_AT25_Open API.

DRV_AT25_GeometryGet(myHandle, &eepromGeometry);

readBlockSize = eepromGeometry.readBlockSize;
nReadBlocks = eepromGeometry.readNumBlocks;
nReadRegions = eepromGeometry.readNumRegions;

writeBlockSize = eepromGeometry.writeBlockSize;
eraseBlockSize = eepromGeometry.eraseBlockSize;

totalFlashSize = readBlockSize * nReadBlocks * nReadRegions;

```

## Remarks

None.
