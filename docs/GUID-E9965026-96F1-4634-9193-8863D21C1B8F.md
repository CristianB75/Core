# DRV\_USART\_BUFFER\_HANDLE Typedef

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-80FC4C27-64D2-411F-BE4A-4C4A8BD80604.md)

## C

```c
typedef uintptr_t DRV_USART_BUFFER_HANDLE;

```

## Summary

Handle identifying a read or write buffer passed to the driver.

## Description

A buffer handle value is returned by a call to the DRV\_USART\_ReadBufferAdd<br />or DRV\_USART\_WriteBufferAdd functions. This handle is associated with the<br />buffer passed into the function and it allows the application to track the<br />completion of the data from \(or into\) that buffer. The buffer handle value<br />returned from the "buffer add" function is returned back to the client<br />by the "event handler callback" function registered with the driver.

The buffer handle assigned to a client request expires when the client has<br />been notified of the completion of the buffer transfer \(after event handler<br />function that notifies the client returns\) or after the buffer has been<br />retired by the driver if no event handler callback was set.

## Remarks

None
