# DRV\_MEMORY\_SyncRead Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-E18B0923-4286-4E08-A2EB-9A482E0063AE.md)

## C

```c
bool DRV_MEMORY_SyncRead
(
    const DRV_HANDLE handle,
    void *targetBuffer,
    uint32_t blockStart,
    uint32_t nBlock
);
```

## Summary

Reads data for the specified number of memory blocks in Synchronous mode.

## Description

This function schedules a blocking read operation for reading blocks of<br />data from the memory device attached.

## Precondition

DRV\_MEMORY\_Open\(\) must have been called with DRV\_IO\_INTENT\_READ or DRV\_IO\_INTENT\_READWRITE as the ioIntent to obtain a valid opened device handle.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open function|
|targetBuffer|Buffer into which the data read from the media device memory will be placed|
|blockStart|Block start from where the data should be read.|
|nBlock|Total number of blocks to be read.|

## Returns

-   true

    -   If the transfer request is successfully completed.

-   false

    -   If the source buffer pointer is NULL

    -   If the client opened the driver for write only

    -   If the number of blocks to be read is either zero or more than the number of blocks actually available

    -   If the driver handle is invalid


## Example

```c
#define BUFFER_SIZE 4096
uint8_t readBuffer[BUFFER_SIZE];

// Use DRV_MEMORY_GeometryGet () to find the read region geometry.
uint32_t blockStart = 0x0;
uint32_t nBlock = BUFFER_SIZE / block_size; // block_size for read geometry

// memoryHandle is the handle returned by the DRV_MEMORY_Open function.

if(DRV_MEMORY_SyncRead(memoryHandle, &readBuffer, blockStart, nBlock) == false)
{
    // Error handling here
}

```

## Remarks

This API is supported only in RTOS environment.
