**Parent topic:**[Direct Memory Access \(DMA\) System Service](GUID-DB773A68-76AC-4900-8C7C-3AC9C38BE0BD.md)

## C

```c
typedef void (*SYS_DMA_CHANNEL_CALLBACK) (SYS_DMA_TRANSFER_EVENT event, uintptr_t contextHandle);

```

## Summary

Pointer to a DMA Transfer Event handler function.

## Description

This data type defines a DMA Transfer Event Handler Function.

A DMA client must register a transfer event handler function of this<br />type to receive transfer related events from the DMA System Service.

If the event is SYS\_DMA\_TRANSFER\_COMPLETE, this means that the data<br />was transferred successfully.

If the event is SYS\_DMA\_TRANSFER\_ERROR, this means that the data was<br />not transferred successfully.

The contextHandle parameter contains the context handle that was provided by<br />the client at the time of registering the event handler. This context handle<br />can be anything that the client consider helpful or necessary to identify<br />the client context object associated with the channel of the DMA that<br />generated the event.

The event handler function executes in an interrupt context of DMA.<br />It is recommended to the application not to perform process intensive<br />operations with in this function.

## Remarks

None.
