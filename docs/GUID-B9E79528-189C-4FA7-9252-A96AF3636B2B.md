# DRV\_MX25L\_Read Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-410DBBCC-D224-45B2-B881-7BFB0DFF0EFC.md)

## C

```c
bool DRV_MX25L_Read( const DRV_HANDLE handle, void *rx_data, uint32_t rx_data_length, uint32_t address );
```

## Summary

Reads n bytes of data from the specified start address of flash memory.

## Description

This function schedules a blocking operation for reading requested<br />number of data bytes from the flash memory.

The request is sent in QUAD\_MODE to flash device.

## Precondition

The DRV\_MX25L\_Open\(\) routine must have been called for the specified MX25L driver instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|
|\*rx\_data|Buffer pointer into which the data read from the MX25L Flash memory will be placed.|
|rx\_data\_length|Total number of bytes to be read.|
|address|Read memory start address from where the data should be read.|

## Returns

*true* - if number of bytes requested are read from flash memory

*false* - if read command itself fails

## Example

```c
#define BUFFER_SIZE 1024
#define MEM_ADDRESS 0x0

DRV_HANDLE handle; // Returned from DRV_MX25L_Open
uint8_t CACHE_ALIGN readBuffer[BUFFER_SIZE];

if (DRV_MX25L_Read(handle, (void *)&readBuffer, BUFFER_SIZE, MEM_ADDRESS) == false)
{
    // Error handling here
}

```

## Remarks

This routine will block waiting until read request is completed successfully.
