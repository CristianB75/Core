# DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_FeatureSet Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-B826AB75-F4E4-4A5B-8189-23C99CCF9936.md)

## C

```c
bool DRV_NAND_FLASH_FeatureSet(const DRV_HANDLE handle, uint8_t *featureData, uint8_t featureDataSize, uint8_t featureAddress)
```

## Summary

Enables or disables target specific features.

## Description

This routine enables or disables target specific features to NAND Flash.

## Preconditions

The DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_Open\(\) routine must have been called for the specified NAND FLASH driver instance.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|
|featureData|Pointer to source buffer containing subfeature data to be programmed into NAND Flash|
|featureDataSize|Total number of subfeature data bytes to be written|
|featureAddress|Specific feature address to be send after command cycle.|

## Returns

*true* - If specific feature is enabled or disabled successfully to the flash

*false* - If invalid handle

## Example

```c
i.e. Disable NAND Flash ECC controller if NAND Flash supports internal ECC controller
#define NAND_FLASH_TARGET_DISABLE_INTERNAL_ECC 0x90
uint8_t featureData[4] = {0, 0, 0, 0};
    DRV_HANDLE handle; // Returned from DRV_NAND_FLASH_Open
    
    if (DRV_NAND_FLASH_FeatureSet(handle, featureData, sizeof(featureData), NAND_FLASH_TARGET_DISABLE_INTERNAL_ECC))
    {
        // Flash internal ECC controller is disabled
    }
```

## Remarks

This routine will block for hardware access.
