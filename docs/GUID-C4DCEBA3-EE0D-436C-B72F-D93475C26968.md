## Summary

Handle identifying commands queued in the driver.

## Description

A command handle is returned by a call to the Read or Write<br />functions. This handle allows the application to track the completion<br />of the operation. This command handle is also returned to the client<br />along with the event that has occurred with respect to the command.<br />This allows the application to connect the event to a specific<br />command in case where multiple commands are queued.

The command handle associated with the command request expires when the<br />client has been notified of the completion of the command \(after event<br />handler function that notifies the client returns\) or after the command<br />has been retired by the driver if no event handler callback was set.
