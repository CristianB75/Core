# DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_Close Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-B826AB75-F4E4-4A5B-8189-23C99CCF9936.md)

## C

```c
void DRV_NAND_FLASH_Close( const DRV_HANDLE handle )
```

## Summary

Closes an opened-instance of the NAND FLASH driver

## Description

This routine closes an opened-instance of the NAND FLASH driver, invalidating<br />the handle.

## Precondition

DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|

## Returns

None

## Example

```c
DRV_HANDLE handle; // Returned from DRV_NAND_FLASH_Open

DRV_NAND_FLASH_Close(handle);
```

## Remarks

After calling this routine, the handle passed in "handle" must not be used with any of the remaining driver routines. A new handle must be obtained by calling DRV\_NAND\_FLASH\_Open before the caller may use the driver again.

Usually there is no need for the driver client to verify that the Close operation has completed.
