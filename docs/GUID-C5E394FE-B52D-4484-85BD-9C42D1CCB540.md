# SYS\_TIME\_TimerReload Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-3D84F884-122D-4A4A-95DA-DFD8C2E84650.md)

## C

```c
SYS_TIME_RESULT SYS_TIME_TimerReload (
    SYS_TIME_HANDLE handle,
    uint32_t count,
    uint32_t period,
    SYS_TIME_CALLBACK callback,
    uintptr_t context,
    SYS_TIME_CALLBACK_TYPE type
);
```

## Summary

Reloads \(or reinitializes\) the software timer instance.

## Description

This function reloads the initial values for an already created/allocated<br />instance of a software timer, even if it is currently running.

## Precondition

The SYS\_TIME\_Initialize must have been called and a valid handle to the software timer to be reloaded must be available.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|Handle to a software timer instance.|
|count|The new value of the counter.|
|period|The new period value.|
|callback|The new callback function pointer. For single shot timers, the callback must be specified. For periodic timers, if the callback pointer is given as NULL, no callback will occur, but SYS\_TIME\_TimerPeriodHasExpired can still be polled to determine if the period has expired for a periodic timer.|
|context|The new caller-defined value that's passed \(unmodified\) back to the client as a parameter of callback function.|
|type|Type of callback requested. If type is SYS\_TIME\_SINGLE, the Callback function will be called once when the time period expires. If type is SYS\_TIME\_PERIODIC Callback function will be called repeatedly, every time the time period expires until the timer object is stopped or deleted.|

## Returns

*SYS\_TIME\_SUCCESS* - If the call succeeded.

*SYS\_TIME\_ERROR* - If the call failed \(and the timer was not modified\).

## Example

Given an implementation of the following function prototype:

```c
void MyNewCallback ( uintptr_t context);
```

The following example updates a software timer instance.

```c
//myNewData is the user-defined data that will be passed back in the registered callback function.
if (SYS_TIME_TimerReload(timer, 0, SYS_TIME_MSToCount(500), &MyNewCallback, (uintptr_t)&myNewData, SYS_TIME_PERIODIC) != SYS_TIME_SUCCESS )
{
    // Handle error
}
```

## Remarks

This function facilitates changing multiple timer parameters quickly and atomically.
