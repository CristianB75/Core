# SYS\_CONSOLE\_Read Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-4923B60C-900F-4BB5-91B7-CE4CA6ED4059.md)

## C

```c
ssize_t SYS_CONSOLE_Read(
    const SYS_CONSOLE_HANDLE handle,
    void* buf,
    size_t count
)
```

## Summary

Reads data from the console device.

## Description

This function reads the data from the console device.

If the data is not read out from the internal receive buffer by calling the<br />SYS\_CONSOLE\_Read API at regular intervals, there is a possibility of the receive<br />buffer becoming full. As a result, the new data may be lost. Hence, the<br />application must call the SYS\_CONSOLE\_Read API at regular intervals to avoid<br />buffer overflow condition.

The SYS\_CONSOLE\_ReadCountGet\(\) and the SYS\_CONSOLE\_ReadFreeBufferCountGet\(\) APIs<br />may be used to know the number of unread bytes available in the receive buffer<br />and the amount of free space available in the receive buffer respectively.

## Preconditions

The SYS\_CONSOLE\_Initialize function should have been called before calling this function.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|Handle to the console instance|
|buf|Buffer to hold the read data.|
|count|Number of bytes to read.|

## Returns

Return value indicates the number of bytes actually read. Returns -1 in case of any error.

## Example

```c
ssize_t nr; //indicates the actual number of bytes read
char myBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];
SYS_CONSOLE_HANDLE myConsoleHandle;

// myConsoleHandle is assumed to be pointing to a valid console handle
nr = SYS_CONSOLE_Read( myConsoleHandle, myBuffer, MY_BUFFER_SIZE );
if (nr == -1)
{
    // Handle error
}
```

## Remarks

None
