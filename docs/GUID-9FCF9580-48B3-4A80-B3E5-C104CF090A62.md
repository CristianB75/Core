**Configuration Options**

-   **PLIB Used:**

    -   Specifies the Peripheral library connected

-   **Number Of Clients:**

    -   Indicates maximum number of clients

    -   Always set to one as it supports only a single client

-   **MX25L Start Address:**

    -   Specifies the flash memory start address to be used for Transfer operations

    -   The start address will be populated in the device geometry table DRV\_MX25L\_GEOMETRY

-   **MX25L Erase Buffer Size:**

    -   This option appears only when the MX25L driver is connected to the Memory driver for block operations

    -   Specifies the size for erase buffer used by Memory driver

    -   The size of the buffer should be equal to erase sector size as the memory driver will call DRV\_MX25L\_SectorErase
