# SYS\_TIME\_DelayIsComplete Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-3D84F884-122D-4A4A-95DA-DFD8C2E84650.md)

## C

```c
bool SYS_TIME_DelayIsComplete ( SYS_TIME_HANDLE handle )
```

## Summary

Determines if the given delay timer has completed.

## Description

This function determines if the requested delay is completed or is still<br />in progress.

## Precondition

A delay request must have been created using either the SYS\_TIME\_DelayMS or SYS\_TIME\_DelayUS functions.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A SYS\_TIME\_HANDLE value provided by either SYS\_TIME\_DelayMS or SYS\_TIME\_DelayUS functions.|

## Returns

*true* - If the delay has completed.

*false* - If the delay has not completed.

## Example

```c
// Check if the delay has expired.
if (SYS_TIME_DelayIsComplete(timer) != true)
{
    // Delay has not expired
}
```

## Remarks

SYS\_TIME\_DelayIsComplete must be called to poll the status of the delay requested through SYS\_TIME\_DelayMS or SYS\_TIME\_DelayUS.

SYS\_TIME\_DelayIsComplete must not be used to poll the status of a periodic timer. Status of a periodic timer may be polled using the SYS\_TIME\_TimerPeriodHasExpired routine.
