# SDSPI Driver

The SDSPI driver is a multi-client multi-instance buffer model based block driver interface which can be used to communicate with SD cards.

**Key Features of Memory Driver:**

-   Supports asynchronous \(non-blocking\) and synchronous \(blocking\) mode of operation

-   Supports both DMA and non-DMA modes

-   The SDSPI driver is capable of interacting to the SD Card either via SPI PLIB interface or via SPI Driver interface, selectable in MHC configuration of the SDSPI driver.

-   The driver API interface can be used directly by the application to read/write directly from the SD Card Or the SDSPI driver can be used with a file system
