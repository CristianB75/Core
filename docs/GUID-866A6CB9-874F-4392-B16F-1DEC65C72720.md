# DRV\_SDMMC\_Close Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-D15D1321-065D-4EA7-A00C-D277A8A66F8D.md)

## C

```c
void DRV_SDMMC_Close ( DRV_HANDLE handle );
```

## Summary

Closes an opened-instance of the SD Card driver.

## Description

This routine closes an opened-instance of the SD Card driver, invalidating<br />the handle.

## Precondition

The DRV\_SDMMC\_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified SD Card driver instance.

DRV\_SDMMC\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|

## Returns

None

## Example

```c
DRV_HANDLE handle; // Returned from DRV_SDMMC_Open

DRV_SDMMC_Close (handle);
```

## Remarks

After calling this routine, the handle passed in "handle" must not be used with any of the remaining driver routines. A new handle must be obtained by calling DRV\_SDMMC\_Open before the caller may use the driver again.

If any requests were queued by the client, the driver will remove those requests from the queue and issue a DRV\_SDMMC\_EVENT\_COMMAND\_ERROR event, \(if an event handler is registered by the client\) before the client is closed.
