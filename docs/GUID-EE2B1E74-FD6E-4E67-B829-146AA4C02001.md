|path|A path for the file/directory, for which the time is to be set.|
|ptr|Pointer to the structure of type SYS\_FS\_TIME, which contains the time data to be set.|

*SYS\_FS\_RES\_SUCCESS* - Set time operation was successful.

*SYS\_FS\_RES\_FAILURE* - Set time operation was unsucessful. The reason for<br />the failure can be retrieved with SYS\_FS\_Error.

## Example

```c
void setTime(void)
{
    SYS_FS_RESULT res;
    SYS_FS_TIME time;

    time.packedTime = 0;

    // All FAT FS times are calculated based on 0 = 1980
    time.discreteTime.year = (2021 - 1980); // Year is 2021
    time.discreteTime.month = 8; // Month (August)
    time.discreteTime.day = 9; // Day (9)
    time.discreteTime.hour = 15; // 3 PM
    time.discreteTime.minute = 06; // 06 minutes
    time.discreteTime.second = 00; // 00 seconds

    res = SYS_FS_FileDirectoryTimeSet("file.txt", &time);

    if( res != SYS_FS_RES_SUCCESS)
    {
        // time change has gone wrong
    }
}
