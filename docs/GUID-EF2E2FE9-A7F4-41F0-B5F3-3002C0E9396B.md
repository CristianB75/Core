**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-E18B0923-4286-4E08-A2EB-9A482E0063AE.md)

## C

```c
void DRV_MEMORY_Write
(
    const DRV_HANDLE handle,
    SYS_MEDIA_BLOCK_COMMAND_HANDLE* commandHandle,
    void* sourceBuffer,
    uint32_t blockStart,
    uint32_t nBlock
)
```

## Summary

Interface to the file system to perform a write operation in Synchronous mode

## Description

This routine provides interface to the file system to perform a media<br />write operation in synchronous mode of the Memory driver.

## Preconditions

The DRV\_MEMORY\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open function|
|commandHandle|Pointer to an argument that will contain the return buffer handle|
|sourceBuffer|The source buffer containing data to be programmed to the SD Card.|
|blockStart|Start block address of SD Card where the writes should begin.|
|nBlock|Total number of blocks to be written.|

## Returns

The buffer handle is returned in the commandHandle argument. It will be DRV\_MEMORY\_COMMAND\_HANDLE\_INVALID if the request was not successful.

## Remarks

This function is internally used by the file system and should not be used by application.
