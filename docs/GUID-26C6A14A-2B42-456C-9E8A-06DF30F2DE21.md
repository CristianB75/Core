# DRV\_USART\_SerialSetup Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-80FC4C27-64D2-411F-BE4A-4C4A8BD80604.md)

## C

```c
bool DRV_USART_SerialSetup
(
    const DRV_HANDLE handle,
    DRV_USART_SERIAL_SETUP* setup
)
```

## Summary

Sets the USART serial communication settings dynamically.

## Description

This function sets the USART serial communication settings dynamically.

## Precondition

DRV\_USART\_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle. The USART transmit or receive transfer status should not be busy.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|handle|A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's open routine|
|setup|Pointer to the structure containing the serial setup.|

## Returns

*true* - Serial setup was updated successfully.

*false* - Failure while updating serial setup.

## Example

```c
// 'handle', returned from the DRV_USART_Open

DRV_USART_SERIAL_SETUP setup = {
    115200,
    DRV_USART_PARITY_ODD,
    DRV_USART_DATA_8_BIT,
    DRV_USART_STOP_1_BIT
};

DRV_USART_SerialSetup(handle, &setup);
```

## Remarks

This routine must not be called from the interrupt context.
