# EMU\_EEPROM\_BufferWrite Function

**Parent topic:**[Library Interface](GUID-000B6F77-4664-4A72-9723-F697040A7436.md)

## C

```c
EMU_EEPROM_STATUS EMU_EEPROM_BufferWrite(
    const uint16_t offset,
    const uint8_t *const data,
    const uint16_t length
);
```

## Summary

Writes a buffer of data to the emulated EEPROM memory space

## Description

Writes a buffer of data to a section of emulated EEPROM memory space.<br />The source buffer may be of any size, and the destination may lie outside<br />of an emulated EEPROM page boundary.

## Precondition

Function EMU\_EEPROM\_Initialize should have been called before calling this function.

## Parameters

|Param|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|offset|Starting byte offset to write to, in emulated EEPROM memory space|
|data|Pointer to the data buffer containing source data to write|
|length|Length of the data to write, in bytes|

## Returns

*EMU\_EEPROM\_STATUS* - Enum of type EMU\_EEPROM\_STATUS. Status code indicating<br />the status of the operation.

## Example

```c
uint8_t my_buffer[5];

EMU_EEPROM_BufferWrite(0, my_buffer, 5);
```

## Remarks

Data stored in pages may be cached in volatile RAM memory; to commit any cached data to physical non-volatile memory, the EMU\_EEPROM\_CachedDataCommit\(\) function should be called.
