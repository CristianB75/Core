# Memory Driver

The Memory driver is a multi-client multi-instance buffer model based block driver interface which can be used to communicate with various media devices.

**Key Features of Memory Driver:**

-   It works in both Asynchronous and Synchronous modes of operation.

-   It works in both Bare Metal and RTOS environment.

-   It can be used to communicate with Different Media's via common Media Interface.

    -   Media which can be accessed directly by Peripheral Libraries \(NVM, RAM\)

    -   Media which can be accessed by protocol drivers which in-turn connect to respective peripheral Libraries

        -   Example: SST26 Driver --\> QSPI peripheral library
